# Kaggle Submissions

Profile: https://www.kaggle.com/stanleyjzheng

Opensource solutions and submissions for some of the Kaggle competitions I have participated in. Medal-winning solutions will be put in a separate repository. Please see each folder for a short readme.

I encourage the reader to see the Global Wheat repository, as it is completed and includes training pipelines and multiple inference notebooks. https://github.com/Stanley-Zheng/Global-Wheat
