# Kaggle Submissions

Opensource solutions and submissions for some of the Kaggle competitions I have participated in. Please see each folder for a short readme with what techniques were used as well as a screenshot of the leaderboard.

Please see my other projects in my github profile for more comprehensive and thorough projects. These Kaggle solutions are mostly written very hastily to work as a solution to the competition, and may have massive bugs or inaccuracies, but they work for the project well enough. Again, please see my other projects, especially [COVID-GoogleNet](https://github.com/Stanley-Zheng/COVID-GoogleNet) for a polished and deployed project.
