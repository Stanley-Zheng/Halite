### Competitions
- [Global Wheat](https://www.kaggle.com/c/global-wheat-detection) by University of Saskatchewan - 74th out of 2245 teams (Top 3%, Silver medal)
    - Object detection competition in which we trained models to place bounding boxes over heads of wheat to allow wheat farmers to quickly and accurately gauge harvest size and density
    - Please see `globalwheat.md` for code, a writeup, and more
- [RSNA-STR Pulmonary Embolism](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-str-pulmonary-embolism-detection) by the Radiological Society of North America - 54th out of 784 teams (top 6.8%)
    - Image classification competition in which 3d dicom CT images of a heart were provided to detect the likelihood of a pulmonary embolism. Provided a unique challenge in the size of the dataset (912gb)
    - Please see `RSNA-STR_pulmonary_embolism.md` for code and a writeup
- [Halite](https://www.kaggle.com/c/halite) by Two Sigma Hedge Fund - 62nd out of 1088 teams (top 6%, bronze medal)
    - "Game" type competition in which 4 bots compete to manage resources and gain the most halite in 400 turns. Reinforcement learning, machine learning, and algorithmic bots were common.
    - Also see [Two Sigma Halite Playground Edition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/halite-iv-playground-edition/leaderboard), where I am first out of 52 participants.
