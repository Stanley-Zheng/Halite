# Kaggle Submissions

Profile: https://www.kaggle.com/stanleyjzheng

Opensource solutions and submissions for some of the Kaggle competitions I have participated in. Please see each folder for a short readme with what techniques were used as well as a screenshot of the leaderboard.

Please see my other projects in my github profile for more comprehensive and thorough projects. These Kaggle solutions are mostly written very hastily to work as a solution to the competition, and may have massive bugs or inaccuracies, but they work for the project well enough. Again, please see my other projects, especially [COVID-GoogleNet](https://github.com/Stanley-Zheng/COVID-GoogleNet) for a polished and deployed project.

Currently working on [Global Wheat Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/global-wheat-detection), a $15000 competition. My team is currently #84 out of  2046 teams, although using a noncompliant model. With any luck, we should be top 50 for private leaderboard. Expect a full write up on our solution to follow. We are currently using effdet, while I am working on yolov4. We hope to be able to ensemblel the models for even more performance.
