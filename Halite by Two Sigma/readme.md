## Halite Version 4 by Two Sigma Quantitative Hedge Fund 

Halite is a side project to me, where I worked on it weekly for a few hours. I did not put a significant amount of time into it like I did with Global Wheat, so my score shows this.

##### Algorithmic solution
`algorithmic.py` contains an algorithmic solution to Halite. It can earn a score of about 1000

##### Reinforcement Learning Solution
`rl.ipynb` contains a reinforcement learning solution using Kaggle datasets. It produces `rl.py`, which can earn a score of about 1150.
