## Open Source Imaging Consortium (OSIC) Pulmonary Fibrosis Progression

This solution is an ensemble between 8 models. We use image classification from Efficientnet B0-B7 trained at 512x512, as well as quantile regression. Quantile regression alone achieves a score of -6.8351, while adding the Efficientnets achieves a score of -6.8218. Training pipelines will be released following the conclusion of this competition.
